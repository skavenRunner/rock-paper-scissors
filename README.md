Pretty quick little game I made for The Odin Project assignment.
It was not really hard but it was great having some freedom to test the different stuff I learned
in a more "realistic" enviroment. Had fun trying different ways of doing the same thing.
Didnt really use git for this one since it didnt take lot, still not sure how much I should commit.
I feel like in my previous project I commited too much... should try and look for balance.
